## Development server - IMPORTANT:

In order to run the application you need to install npm and then angular cli.
Here's the link with instructions: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.

When you have installed npm and ng, then run `ng serve` within the project folder in order to run the application. 
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

In file src/app/offers/offer.service.ts is stored configuration to the backend server.
Adjust backendAddress property accordingly to your backend running server address in order to communicate properly betwen the front and the backend.
